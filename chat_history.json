It is an agile methodology that helps teams work together to efficiently address complex adaptive problems while delivering high-value products. Key components of Scrum include:\n\n1. **Roles**: There are three primary roles within a Scrum team:\n   - **Product Owner**: Responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team.\n   - **Scrum Master**: Ensures that the team lives by the values and practices of Scrum. The Scrum Master acts as a facilitator and helps remove impediments that the team may encounter.\n   - **Development Team**: A group of professionals who do the actual work of delivering potentially releasable increments of the \"Done\" product at the end of each Sprint.\n\n2. **Events/Ceremonies**: Scrum prescribes a set of events to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum:\n   - **Sprint**: A time-boxed period (usually 2-4 weeks) during which a \"Done\", useable, and potentially releasable product increment is created.\n   - **Sprint Planning**: A meeting at the start of the sprint where the team decides what work will be done during that sprint.\n   - **Daily Scrum (or Daily Standup)**: A short (15 minutes or less) meeting held each day of the sprint, where team members synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.\n   - **Sprint Review**: Held at the end of the sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.\n   - **Sprint Retrospective**: Occurs after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning. This meeting is for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.\n\n3. **Artifacts**: These provide key information that the team needs to understand how the product is coming along and what needs to be done next:\n   - **Product Backlog**: An ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product, maintained by the Product Owner.\n   - **Sprint Backlog**: A set of items selected from the Product Backlog to be completed during the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.\n   - **Increment**: The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints.\n\nScrum emphasizes real-time communication, team self-management, and the flexibility to adapt to emerging business realities.",
